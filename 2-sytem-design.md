# 🏗️ System Design Fundamentals

> This section helps you define how your application will be structured, deployed, and scaled. It ensures your system is designed to meet current and future demands while maintaining performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## 🧱 Architecture Patterns

### 🧩 Chosen Architecture Pattern:
- [ ] Monolithic
- [ ] Microservices
- [ ] Serverless
- [ ] Hybrid / Other: `______________`

### 💡 Justification for Architecture Choice:
> Why is this pattern suitable for your project? Mention factors like team size, deployment complexity, scalability, and maintainability.

---

### 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

- **Core Components / Services:**
- **Key Communication Mechanisms (REST, gRPC, Events, etc.):**
- **Technology Stack Overview:**
- **Deployment Strategy:**
- **Expected User Load / Traffic Profile:**
- **Basic Security Measures (auth, access control, etc.):**

---

### 📈 Scalability Strategy
> How will your system handle growth and high traffic?

- **Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling Approach:**
- **Load Balancing Mechanism:**
- **Expected Bottlenecks and Mitigation Plan:**

---

### 🔐 Security Architecture
> Outline security considerations at the design level.

- **Authentication & Authorization Strategy (OAuth2, JWT, etc.):**
- **Data Encryption (at rest & in transit):**
- **Basic Threat Model (e.g., common attack surfaces):**
- **Compliance Requirements (if any):**

---

### 🔄 State Management Strategy

- **Frontend State Management (e.g., Redux, Context API):**
- **Backend Session Handling (stateless/stateless):**
- **Caching Strategy (e.g., Redis, CDN caching):**

---

### 🔗 Integration Points

> List any external or internal systems you need to connect with.

- **Third-Party Services/APIs:**
- **Internal Microservices (if applicable):**
- **Fallbacks or Mocking Plans for Dev/Test:**

---

### 🔍 Architecture Comparison (Optional)
> Briefly mention why other options were not chosen.

| Architecture    | Pros                           | Cons                            | Why Not Chosen?                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Monolithic      |                                |                                  |                                |
| Microservices   |                                |                                  |                                |
| Serverless      |                                |                                  |                                |

## 🗃️ Database Design

### 🧠 Chosen Database Type:
- [ ] Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- [ ] NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- [ ] Both (Polyglot Persistence)

**Rationale for Choice:**  
> Consider query patterns, data relationships, scalability, and complexity.

---

### 📊 Data Modeling
