## [6. DevOps and CI/CD](./6-devops.md)

### Key Actions:
- **Set Up CI**: Automate testing with a CI tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- **Deploy Automatically (CD)**: Implement continuous deployment strategies to automate pushing changes to production.

**Goal**: Implement automated pipelines for testing and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

---

## [7. Documentation](./7-documentation.md)

### Key Actions:
- **Write Technical Documentation**: Create system architecture, API docs, and setup guides.
- **Code Documentation**: Comment your code and maintain a README, changelog, and other relevant documents.

**Goal**: Ensure that the project is well-documented for future developers and collaborators.
