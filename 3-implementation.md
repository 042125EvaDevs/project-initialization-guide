# 🧪 Practical Implementation

> This section puts all the planning and design into motion. Use this checklist to simulate or perform your first implementation sprint. Ensure your foundations are solid, maintainable, and ready for iteration.

---

## 1. 🔧 Project Initialization

- [ ] Git repository created
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured
- [ ] Initial README with project description
- [ ] Project license added (MIT, GPL, etc.)
- [ ] Project structure scaffolded (e.g., `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`)
- [ ] Initial commit created
- [ ] Project hosted on:
  - [ ] GitHub
  - [ ] GitLab
  - [ ] Bitbucket
  - [ ] Other: `______________`

---

## 2. 🗂️ Base Structure Setup

- [ ] File/folder naming conventions defined
- [ ] Feature/module boundaries clarified
- [ ] Frontend/backend separated (if applicable)
- [ ] Shared utilities/helpers placed in common folder
- [ ] Starter environment set up:
  - [ ] Docker Compose / local server
  - [ ] Frontend dev server
  - [ ] Pre-seeded database (mock or local)

---

## 3. 🔁 Code Quality & Standards

- [ ] Code formatter configured (Prettier, Black, etc.)
- [ ] Linter installed and configured
- [ ] Git hooks set up (Husky, lint-staged)
- [ ] CI pipeline runs on push or PR
- [ ] Test framework initialized:
  - [ ] Unit tests
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] E2E tests (if applicable)

---

## 4. 🧪 First Implementation Tasks

Choose 1–3 tasks based on your project design (simulating a real-world Agile sprint):

- [ ] Create first feature/module/component (e.g. auth, user profile, home page)
- [ ] Write tests for first feature/module
- [ ] Connect basic route/endpoint/API call
- [ ] Render sample UI with dummy data
- [ ] Save or retrieve from local DB or mocked API

_Example tasks:_
- [ ] `[Frontend]` Create login page with validation
- [ ] `[Backend]` Set up `/api/auth/register` route
- [ ] `[DevOps]` Dockerize and test local deployment

---

## 5. 🔁 Validation and Feedback Loop

- [ ] Code reviewed by peer or mentor
- [ ] Dev logs reviewed for errors or bottlenecks
- [ ] Code is pushed and CI passes
- [ ] Tests passing and coverage validated
- [ ] Lessons noted for future iterations:
  - What was tricky?
  - What worked well?
  - What should be improved?

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections

- [ ] Initial experience summary:
  - What assumptions were validated or disproven?
  - Were tools and setup choices adequate?
  - Any blockers or unexpected insights?
